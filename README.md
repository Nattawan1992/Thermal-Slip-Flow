# Thermal-Slip-Flow
This project is to analyse pressure-driven flows of Newtonian fluid and thermal energy in elliptical microchannel with radial oscillating wall. Governing equations were established for the fully developed flow of fluid in the channel, and taken into account the slip condition on the boundary. Semi-analytical solutions were carried out by Ritz method. The influences of model parameters including slip length and amplitude of wall oscillation on the flow phenomena are analysed.
